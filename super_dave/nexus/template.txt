[[short_description]]

Arutsuyo:
I've picked this mod up from the previous creator and extended it to support more features!
So far I've finished the Harpoon Head granting!
I've implemented a Gun Hotswap feature with level checks!
I also added a full heal hotkey.

See the config options below for a complete list of features and how to use them.  If you have ideas or issues see the [i]Source Code and Bug Reporting[/i] section at the bottom of the page.  Thanks!

[size=4][b][u]Config Options[/u][/b][/size]

Note that all of the options in this mod default to off (false, zero, blank, etc) to enable the user to have as little of a "cheaty" experience as possible. 

For information on how to modify these options, see the [i]Editing the Config File[/i] section below.

[size=4][b][u]Auto-pickup Items Config File[/u][/b][/size]
There is a new config file that will be created after the first run of this version of the mod, BepInEx/config/auto-pickup-items.txt.  The file defines which items will be picked up when auto-pickup is enabled.  Instructions for usage are in the file.  Please let me know here if there are items that are safe to always pick up that I missed (i.e. still commented with a '#')  Note that fish are picked up using different logic and those lines will be ignored.
